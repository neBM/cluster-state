Log shipping: NOT CONFIGURED - Needs separate Filebeat/Elastic Agent deployment
NOTE: Log shipping was tied to the Nomad ELK infrastructure and needs to be
      separately configured for K8s. This is out of scope for the ES migration.

## Kibana Connectivity to ES
Kibana logs show: 'Successfully connected to Elasticsearch'
Kibana status: All 176 plugins started successfully

## RESULT: US3 PARTIAL - ES and Kibana working, log shipping needs reconfiguration
